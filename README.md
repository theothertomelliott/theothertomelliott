### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my side projects go here, but I also maintain a "Cloud Lab" for messing around with multi-cloud and infrastructure-as-code things at https://github.com/telliott-io.

A few other places you can find me are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theotherelliott), and [Medium](https://medium.com/average-coder).
