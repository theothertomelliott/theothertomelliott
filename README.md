### Hi there 👋

Great to meet you! I'm Tom Elliott, a software developer and sometime public speaker based in New York.

Since joining the industry in 2007, I've had the good fortune to work in a number of different areas, including enterprise VDI, VPN clients, mobile apps and SaaS applications. In recent years, I've found my niche and passion in DevOps.

I blog regularly at [telliott.me](https://telliott.me) about CI/CD, DevOps and other software engineering concerns.
